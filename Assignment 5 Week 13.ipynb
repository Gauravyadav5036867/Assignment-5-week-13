    "\n",
    ". Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical variables have a natural order or hierarchy.\n",
    ". In ordinal encoding, each unique category is assigned a numerical value based on its rank or order.\n",
    ". For example, in a variable like \"education level\" with categories like \"High School\", \"College\", and \"Graduate\", you might assign the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively to represent their increasing levels of education.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the relationship between the categories and the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem. It's particularly useful when dealing with classification tasks. The basic idea is to replace the categorical labels with ordinal numbers based on the target variable's distribution within each category.\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Calculate Aggregate Statistics: For each category in the categorical variable, calculate aggregate statistics such as mean, median, mode, etc., of the target variable within that category. Typically, mean or median is used.\n",
    "    2. Order Categories by Aggregate Statistics: Order the categories based on the computed aggregate statistics. For instance, if using mean, categories with higher mean values are considered to have a higher priority.\n",
    "    3. Assign Ordinal Values: Assign ordinal values to the categories based on their order determined by the aggregate statistics. This creates a meaningful ordinal relationship between the categories and the target variable.\n",
